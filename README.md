# PwC-Power-BI-in-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Case-Experience
ðŸŒŸ **Call Center Analytics:**
My role in the Virtual Case Experience using Power BI for Forage included crafting a dynamic dashboard that illuminated crucial call center trends. I creatively presented key performance indicators (KPIs) such as customer satisfaction, call volumes, average speed of answer, and agent performance. This visually engaging dashboard empowered stakeholders, including Claire, facilitating data-driven decisions and providing insightful analyses.

ðŸŒŸ **Customer Retention Focus:**
A notable segment of the project involved developing a dashboard tailored to address customer retention concerns. Prompted by direct engagement with a Retention Manager from a prominent telecom company, I delved into comprehensive analysis and visualisation. This led to valuable insights into customer churn, and subsequently facilitating a collaborative meeting between the Retention Manager and the PwC engagement partner. together, strategised proactive measures to identify at-risk customers and optimise retention efforts.

ðŸŒŸ **Diversity and Inclusion Insights:**
Contributing to the broader scope, I tackled diversity and inclusion challenges within the HR department. I conducted a thorough analysis of workforce data, focusing on metrics like gender distribution, turnover rates, promotion rates, and performance ratings. The outcomes provided meaningful insights, guiding the development of effective diversity and inclusion strategies.

This experience underscores my adeptness in leveraging visualisation tools like Power BI to drive efficiency, innovation, and problem-solving within Business Services. By blending technical prowess with a keen understanding of client needs, I actively contributed to the organisation's digital transformation journey. My role facilitated data-driven decision-making and fostered a culture of continuous improvement.
